Remember that video you saw of the golf ball hitting a steel wall and bouncing
like a bouncy-ball? Yeah. We are going to test that. Now.

This should be a simple process. We create a sphere of spheres with Hooke's law
keeping them together. We launch it at a wall and see it bounce back.

We should see that the spring constant must be drastically different for a golf
ball and a bouncy ball...

And yeah, this is just a first approximation. The spring constant changes in the
middle of a golf ball. Look up golf ball manufacturing. 

I don't think the dimples should play an effect, really. If they do, that's too
much computational power.

That is all.
