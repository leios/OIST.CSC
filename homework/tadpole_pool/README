Let's say you are a biologist who has a little computational knowledge and have
created a little robot to scour Lake Idonwannacode for frogs of all different 
stages of development. As the robot goes around the pond, you notice it is not
counting the frogs properly! Your job is to write a function that can properly
bin the data this robot collects. By this, I mean that your code should be able
to accept the age of a frog and place the frog into bins accoding to their age. 
For the sake of this example, let's just create bins for every year of frog
development.

In this assignment, I have created a function for you to use in the file 
"frog_found.py". This file will randomly pull a frog from the appropriate 
distribution of frogs in a pond and output that frog's age. Please use this
function in your code. If you don't, though, it's not too big of a deal.

The function you need is "find_frog". It outputs a random number in years, in
precisely the same way we have been returning numbers from functions before.

Oh. I also didn't use any tricks with the "frog_found.py" file. You should be
able to follow it. Please feel free to open it up and take a look!
